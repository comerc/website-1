After months of intense development, we're thrilled to announce the public launch of
[Conductor](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/gateway) - our latest venture into the world of GraphQL!

## For the Community, Embracing All GraphQL Projects

Conductor has been crafted with a clear vision: to empower developers with their advanced GraphQL
needs:

- **Built with Rust**: Focused on performance and reliability, leveraging Rust's safety and
  concurrency capabilities.
- **Exceptional Developer Experience**: We understand that developer experience is crucial. That's
  why Conductor is designed to be intuitive, straightforward, and hassle-free, allowing you to focus
  on what matters most - building great and performant GraphQL applications.
- **Real open-source**: Conductor is designed to be accessible to everyone, it is open-source (MIT)
  and free - and will always be. You can self-host it!
- **Supporting Diverse GraphQL Architectures**: Whether you're working with federated, or standalone
  APIs, Conductor is versatile enough to handle it all. Our goal is to provide a gateway that adapts
  to all graphql projects' needs.
- **Community-Driven Development**: As a community-focused organization, The Guild is constantly
  seeking feedback and contributions. Our roadmap is public! Your insights and suggestions will
  shape the future of Conductor, making it a tool by the community, for the community.

## Unpacking Conductor's Feature Set

Conductor isn't just another tool; it's a comprehensive solution for managing your GraphQL
architecture. Here's a glimpse of what it offers:

- **GraphQL Spec Compliance**: Fully adheres to the GraphQL specification, ensuring reliable and
  standard-compliant behavior.
- **Advanced Gateway Capabilities**: Serves as a dynamic very thin layer with minimal overhead
  between GraphQL consumers and servers, enhancing GraphQL runtime with robust plugins for caching,
  authentication, rate limiting, CORS, persisted queries (trusted documents), and OpenTelemetry.
- **Distributed Schemas**: Seamlessly integrates with Apollo Federation (experimental), managing all
  aspects from query planning to response merging.
- **Flexible and Scalable**: Whether you're working on a small project or a large enterprise
  application, Conductor scales with your needs. Its architecture is modular, and can fully
  efficiently utlize your hardware resources.
- **Extensible Endpoint Configuration**: Allows exposure of multiple GraphQL endpoints from a single
  instance with configurable plugins per endpoint.
- **VRL (Vector Routing Language) Support**: Offers limitless possibilities for custom logic,
  plugins, and response transformers.
- **Comprehensive Security & Monitoring**: Built-in support for various authentication methods,
  authorization, rate limiting, and OpenTelemetry for monitoring.
- **Flexible runtime**: Conductor runs either as a binary (and dockerized), and can also run on the
  Edge (CloudFlare Worker).

## Use It Today!

Conductor's configuration can be defined in both YAML and JSON formats. The config file contains
several key sections:

- **Server**: Configure the HTTP server settings, including port and host.
- **Logger**: Set up logging levels for Conductor's operations.
- **Sources**: Define the GraphQL sources/endpoints that Conductor will interact with. We support
  both monolith GraphQL and Federation sources.
- **Endpoints**: Specify the GraphQL endpoints Conductor will expose, including path, source, and
  plugins.
- **Plugins**: List global plugins that apply to all endpoints, including CORS, authentication, and
  more.

### Configuration File Example

```yaml
server:
  port: 9000

logger:
  level: info

sources:
  - type: graphql
    id: my-source
    config:
      endpoint: https://my-source.com/graphql

endpoints:
  - path: /graphql
    from: my-source
    plugins:
      - type: graphiql

plugins:
  - type: cors
    config:
      allowed_origin: '*'
```

### Running Conductor

Conductor can be ran via the docker image, and it can even be ran via npx for quick and convenient
usage. It also fully supports running as a WASM on Cloudflare Workers, providing flexibility in
deployment options.

```sh
npx @graphql-conductor/bin ./conductor.config.yaml
```

For more details on setting up and running Conductor, refer to our documentation.
