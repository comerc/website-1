The community gathered together in San Francisco for
[**the first-ever GraphQL Conference**](https://graphql.org/conf), almost 10 years after GraphQL was
invented. It was an extraordinary event that brought together developers, enthusiasts, and experts
from all over the world. Over the course of three action-packed days, filled with amazing workshops,
exciting talks, and interesting sponsor booths, we had the incredible opportunity to immerse
ourselves in the world of GraphQL.

One of the highlights of the conference was the chance to meet and shake hands with
[Lee Byron](https://twitter.com/leeb), the visionary behind GraphQL. We expressed our heartfelt
gratitude for his groundbreaking invention and the positive impact it has had on the developer
community. It was truly inspiring to see the faces of the people we had only known through outdated
avatars on GitHub or Twitter, who are the driving force behind the vibrant GraphQL community.

**The conference was a testament to the growing popularity and importance of GraphQL.** Whether
attendees were just starting to explore GraphQL, had already adopted it, or were active contributors
in the GraphQL ecosystem, everyone played a vital role in the success and future of GraphQL. The
energy and enthusiasm in the conference halls were palpable, and it was evident that we are just
scratching the surface of what GraphQL can achieve.

Beyond the exciting atmosphere, the conference also provided valuable insights and knowledge
sharing. One of the key takeaways was the emergence of GraphQL gateways as a buzzword. For a long
time, developers had limited options when it came to choosing a GraphQL gateway. However, now we are
**witnessing a flourishing and diverse range of gateways being built in various languages** like
Apollo Router, Banana Cake Pop, Cosmos, Mesh, or Conductor. The future promises friendly competition
between the teams and companies behind these projects.

But what exactly is the role of a gateway in the GraphQL ecosystem? The answer lies in **composite
schemas**. The conference shed light on various initiatives, from schema stitching to Apollo
Federation, that are revolutionizing the way we work with GraphQL. The Open Federation initiative
aims to establish a specification for Federation, while the GraphQL Fusion initiative challenges the
existing patterns of specification-less Apollo Federation with a fresh approach. It's an exciting
time to witness the solutions that will shape the future of GraphQL and cater to different use
cases.

However, it's important to note that schema composition, GraphQL gateways, and other tools should be
adopted based on their practical benefits in specific workflows. The conference emphasized that
these solutions should be embraced only if they genuinely enhance the efficiency and productivity of
your company's engineering team. GraphQL Fusion, for example, offers adaptability to any GraphQL
setup, making it easier to migrate to a more distributed setup in the future. On the other hand,
Federation requires a specific subgraph structure. Additionally, it was interesting to learn that
even Facebook, with its vast resources, finds value in a monolithic approach for their GraphQL
implementation.

Another significant aspect highlighted during the conference was the **need for continuous education
and knowledge sharing within the GraphQL community**. While there are numerous tutorials and guides
available for specific libraries and frameworks, there is a growing demand for more generic best
practices that can be applied across different GraphQL solutions. Topics like security through
persisted queries or HTTP and response caching sparked engaging discussions among developers,
showcasing the collective effort needed to improve GraphQL implementation within companies.

Lastly, the conference showcased several innovative projects that challenge the way we currently use
GraphQL. Grafast, for instance, introduces a more efficient approach to implementing GraphQL
schemas, while Houdini and Isograph are exciting new GraphQL clients inspired by Relay, taking the
GraphQL experience to new heights. These projects sparked lively discussions and left us with a
sense of anticipation and plenty of new ideas to explore and improve the GraphQL community as a
whole.

We extend our heartfelt **thanks to everyone who attended GraphQL Conf 2023**. For those who
couldn't make it, don't worry! The recordings of all the workshops and talks are already
[available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@GraphQLFoundation), ensuring that the knowledge and
insights shared during the conference can reach a wider audience. We also invite you to join the
discussions on the official [GraphQL discord](discord.graphql.org), where the vibrant community
continues to thrive.

**The overwhelming response and attendance at the conference have made clear that GraphQL Conf will
return in 2024.** So, if you missed out this year, there will be more opportunities to meet and
connect with the GraphQL community.

**See you next year!**
