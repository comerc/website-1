## Introduction

About two years ago, I began my journey to become a developer, driven by a strong passion for
learning and creating. As a junior developer, I was eager to find a project that would help me grow
my skills while being fun and interesting.

For my project, I needed to use an REST API, to be specific. This API allows me to fetch data from a
server and use it in my application. It supports operations like reading (GET), updating (PUT),
creating (POST), and deleting (DELETE) various types of data.

Working with REST APIs can be tricky due to issues like the lack of type safety, which can lead to
errors and bugs during development. In this blog post, I'll introduce you to `feTS`, a solution that
simplifies REST API development. `feTS` help with these challenges, making API development more
reliable and straight forward.

## Introducing `feTS`: Type-Safe REST API Development

`feTS`, which stands for 'Fetch' and 'TypeScript,' is a modern technology that enhances REST APIs.
By using TypeScript and the OpenAPI specification, feTS ensures that data exchanged between the
client and server is clearly defined and error-free. This proactive approach identifies and prevents
errors during development, making your applications more dependable and robust.

## A Practical Example: Leveraging `feTS` for Soccer Team Information

To illustrate the power of `feTS`, let's dive into a real-world example. We'll build a demo app that
interacts with the
[SportStats](https://sportsdata.io/developers/api-documentation/soccer#/sports-data-feeds) V4 API
using `feTS`. Our goal is to fetch soccer team information and display it in an intuitive user
interface.

### Step 1: Obtain a Free Trial Token for Sportstats

To get started, create a free trial Token for SportStats API access. The registration process is
straight forward and won't take much time. You can find the registration form
[here](https://sportsdata.io/cart/free-trial).

By the way, you can choose any other API you want, but for this example, we will use the SportStats
API. You can find openApi at `APIS.GURU` [website](https://apis.guru/about/)

### Step 2: Incorporate OpenAPI Definitions into TypeScript

To integrate OpenAPI definitions into a TypeScript file and export them using the `as const`
modifier. This process ensures strong typing and easy integration with `feTS`. A sample code snippet
is provided below:

```typescript filename="openapi.ts"
export default { openapi: '3.0.0' /* ... */ } as const
```

`openapi.ts` GitHub file
[here](https://github.com/TuvalSimha/feTS-example/blob/main/src/fets/openapi.ts). You can choose any
OpenAPI file you want, but for this example, we will use the SportStats OpenAPI file. You can find
the OpenAPI file [here](https://sportsdata.io/developers/sports-data-open-api-swagger-files).

### Step 3: Install `feTS` and Create a Client

Now, we are ready to install `feTS` and create a new client. To do this, you can visit the docs
[here](https://the-guild.dev/openapi/fets/client/quick-start#installation).

Next, create a new `TypeScript` file and import the `createClient` function from the `feTS` package.
Then, use the `createClient` function to instantiate a new client.

```typescript filename="client.ts"
import { createClient, type NormalizeOAS } from 'feTS'
import type openapi from './openapi'

export const client = createClient<NormalizeOAS<typeof openapi>>({
  endpoint: 'https://api.sportsdata.io/v4/soccer/stats'
})
```

`client.ts` GitHub file
[here](https://github.com/TuvalSimha/feTS-example/blob/main/src/fets/client.ts).

In the code below, we demonstrate how to set up the `feTS` client with a custom error handling
plugin. This plugin is added to enhance the error handling capabilities of the client. This
error-handling plugin is to provide a robust mechanism for handling HTTP errors that may occur
during API requests. When the server responds with an error status code, this plugin ensures that an
informative error message is thrown, including the status code, status text, and the URL that
triggered the error.

```typescript filename="client.ts"
/* eslint-disable react-hooks/rules-of-hooks */
import { ClientPlugin, createClient, type NormalizeOAS } from 'feTS'
import type openapi from './openapi'

function useErrorHandler(): ClientPlugin {
  return {
    onResponse({ response }) {
      if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error(
          `Request failed with status ${response.status}, ${response.statusText}, ${response.url}`
        )
      }
    }
  }
}

export const client = createClient<NormalizeOAS<typeof openapi>>({
  plugins: [useErrorHandler()],
  endpoint: 'https://api.sportsdata.io/v4/soccer/stats'
})
```

By using the custom plugins, you can add your own logic to the client. You can find more information
about plugins [here](https://the-guild.dev/openapi/fets/client/plugins).

### Step 4: Use the Client to Fetch Data from the API

Now, let's use our client to get data from the API. We'll use the `feTS` client we made earlier to
fetch information from the SportStats API. The fetchAllClubs function will show how `feTS` makes it
easy to request data from the API and deal with the results.

```typescript filename="endpoint.ts"
export async function fetchAllClubs() {
  const response = await client['/{format}/Teams/{competition}'].get({
    params: {
      competition: 'EPL',
      format: 'json'
    },
    headers: {
      'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key': YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
    },
    query: {
      key: YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
    }
  })

  const data = await response.json()

  return data
}
```

In this code snippet, we bring in the client object we made using `feTS`. The `fetchAllClubs`
function shows how to use this client to send a `GET` request to the SportStats API's
`/Teams/{competition}` endpoint. We provide the needed details like the competition and format as
well as the required authentication headers. Your IDE should automatically fill in these parameters
for you.

### Step 5: Use the Data from the API

In this step, we'll demonstrate how to use the data fetched from the SportStats API using the
`fetchAllClubs` function. We'll utilize the `useQuery` hook from the `react-query` library to
efficiently manage data fetching and rendering in our React application.

The `useQuery` hook from the react-query library provides a convenient way to fetch and manage
asynchronous data in a React component. It abstracts away the complex logic of data fetching,
caching, and error handling.

Here's an example of how you can use `useQuery` to fetch and display data from the SportStats API in
your `App.tsx` component:

```typescript filename="App.tsx"
import { useQuery } from 'react-query'
import { fetchAllClubs } from './feTS/endpoint'

function App() {
  const { data, isLoading, error } = useQuery('clubs', fetchAllClubs)

  if (isLoading) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>
  }

  if (error) {
    return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>
  }

  return (
    <div>
      {data?.map(club => (
        <div key={club.TeamId}>{club.Name}</div>
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

For more advanced and design example, you can check out the
[example](https://github.com/TuvalSimha/feTS-example/blob/main/src/App.tsx) in the GitHub
repository.

Lets create a design example for our soccer teams data:

```typescript filename="App.tsx"
import { useState } from 'react'
import { useQuery } from 'react-query'
import { TeamsCards } from './components/teams-crads'
import { fetchAllClubs } from './feTS/endpoint'
import { Club } from './feTS/type-helpers'

export function App() {
  const [selectedClub, setSelectedClub] = useState<Club | undefined>(undefined)

  const { data, isLoading, error } = useQuery('clubs', fetchAllClubs)

  if (isLoading) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>
  }

  if (error) {
    return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <TeamsCards clubData={data} setSelectedClub={setSelectedClub} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

In this code snippet, i created a custom component called `TeamsCards` (GitHub file
link)[https://github.com/TuvalSimha/feTS-example/blob/main/src/components/teams-crads.tsx] that
renders a list of cards with the club's name and logo. When the user clicks on a card, the
`setSelectedClub` function is called with the selected club as an argument. This allows us to
display the selected club's information in a separate component.

In your code snippet, you've leveraged the power of `feTS` to define the Club type, which represents
a structured and strongly-typed representation of the data schema for a soccer club. This type is
essential for maintaining type safety and ensuring that the data exchanged between your application
and the API is well-defined and consistent.

The `Club` type is inferred using `feTS` `OASModel` type.This type inference mechanism allows you to
generate TypeScript types directly from the OpenAPI schema defined in your `openapi` file. Here's
how you've done it:

```typescript filename="type-helpers.ts"
import { NormalizeOAS, OASModel } from 'feTS'
import openapi from './openapi'

export type Club = OASModel<NormalizeOAS<typeof openapi>, 'Team'>
```

GitHub file [here](https://github.com/TuvalSimha/feTS-example/blob/main/src/fets/type-helpers.ts).

And its done! You've successfully created a React application that fetches data from the SportStats
API using `feTS`.
